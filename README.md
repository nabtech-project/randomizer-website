# Randomizer Team Generator

This is a simple web-based tool that helps users randomly generate teams from a list of people. The tool allows users to input the names of people and specify the team size. The names are then shuffled, and teams are created automatically, with the option of handling any leftover people (by placing them in a common group or smaller teams).

## Features

- **Random Team Generation:** Enter a list of people and specify the team size. The tool will randomly divide people into teams.
- **Customizable Team Sizes:** The tool handles different scenarios based on the number of people and the specified team size.
- **Common Group Handling:** If there are leftover people who can't be added to teams, they are placed in a "Common" group.
- **Random Team Names:** The tool assigns random names (like "Spartans", "Titans", etc.) to the generated teams.

## How to Use

1. **Input the names** of the people you want to include in the teams. Separate the names with commas (e.g., "Alice, Bob, Charlie").
2. **Select the team size** you would like (e.g., 2 for two people per team).
3. **Click the "Generate Teams" button** to randomly divide the people into teams.
4. If there are extra people who can't be evenly divided, they will be placed in a "Common" group.
